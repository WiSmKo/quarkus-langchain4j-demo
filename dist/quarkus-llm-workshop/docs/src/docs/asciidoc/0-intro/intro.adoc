[[introduction]]
= Welcome

You are going to embark on a transformative journey as we explore the integration of AI into enterprise applications during this workshop.
With technology evolving at an unprecedented pace, this session aims to demystify the process of infusing Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLM) into Quarkus applications.

== Once upon a time, Quarkus

Quarkus was released in March 2019 by a team of engineers that dreamed of supercharging Java for Cloud/Kubernetes deployments while bringing Joy back to Developers.
Over the past decades, Java has been the dominant language for enterprise development.
It has been used to build and run some of the most critical applications in the world.
However, the world has changed.
The Cloud and Kubernetes have become the new deployment platforms of choice. Java has not been able to keep up with the new requirements of Cloud Native development.
Quarkus was created to address this gap.

If you go to the https://quarkus.io[Quarkus web site], you'll read that Quarkus is "_A Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot & GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards_."
This description is somewhat unclear but does an outstanding job at using bankable keywords.
It's also written: "_Supersonic Subatomic Java_."
This is a way of saying that Quarkus is really fast, and itâ€™s really light.
But what does Quarkus _do_?

In practice, Quarkus is a stack to develop distributed systems and modern applications in Java or  Kotlin.
Quarkus applications are tailored for the Cloud, containers, and Kubernetes.
That does not mean you can't use Quarkus in other environments, there are no limits, but the principles infused in Quarkus have made containerization of applications more efficient.

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Quarkus to implement and execute enterprise Java applications.

== When Quarkus meets AI

AI is reshaping the software landscape, influencing user interactions and the foundations of software development.
But, AI and Java have not been the best of friends.

The Quarkus team has been thinking about that problem for a while.
They have been thinking about how to make AI and Java work together, but not just any Java, _Quarkus Java_.

Integrating AI can be done in many ways.
But, properly integrating AI in an enterprise application is not trivial.
There are many challenges, including:

- How to integrate AI in an application without leaking concepts everywhere?
- How to make this AI integration _observable_?
- What about auditing?
- How to provide data to the AI to improve the prediction accuracy?

In this workshop, you will learn how to integrate AI in a Quarkus application.

=== What are you going to learn?

This workshop is divided into four parts.

* _Slot 1: Unveiling the Potential - Integrating OpenAI with Quarkus_

** Experience the hype: Learn to integrate OpenAI into a Quarkus application seamlessly.
** Designing Interactions: Explore strategies for crafting meaningful interactions with large language models.
** AI Empowerment: Discover tools and techniques for providing robust control over AI within your application.

* _Slot 2: Augmented Generation - Extending Hosted LLMs with Local Documents_

** Shift gears: Explore another LLM and extend its capabilities using local documents.
** Retrieval Augmented Generation: Delve into one of the core patterns in AI usage, understanding the synergy between your data and LLM interactions.

* _Slots 3 & 4: OpenShift AI - Training and Hosting Your Own Model_

** Harness the power of OpenShift AI and its MLOps capabilities: Learn how it facilitates the training and hosting of custom AI models.
** Practical Integration: Witness the integration of a custom model into a Quarkus application to complete the end-to-end narrative.

== Prerequisites


This workshop should be as self-explanatory as possible.
So your job is to follow the instructions by yourself, do what you are supposed to do, and do not hesitate to ask for any clarification or assistance; that's why the team is here.

You will download a zip file ({github-raw}/dist/quarkus-llm-workshop.zip[`quarkus-llm-workshop.zip`]) containing the code.

First of all, make sure you have a 64-bit computer with admin rights (so you can install all the needed tools) and at least 8Gb of RAM (as some tools need a few resources).

[WARNING]
====
If you are using Mac OS X, make sure the version is greater than 10.11.x (El Capitan).
====

This workshop will make use of the following software, tools, frameworks that you will need to install and know (more or less) how it works:

* Any IDE you feel comfortable with (eg. Intellij IDEA, Eclipse IDE, VS Code..)
* JDK {jdk-version}
* Docker or Podman (See instructions in xref:../X-appendix/installing-docker.adoc[the appendix])
* cURL (should already be installed in your OS, if not, check xref:../X-appendix/installing-curl.adoc[the appendix for installation instructions]) and `jq` (See instructions in xref:../X-appendix/installing-jq.adoc[the jq installation page])
* An OpenAI or Azure OpenAI keys

We will also be using Maven {maven-version}, but there is no need to install it.
Instead, the workshop scaffolding includes a maven wrapper, `mvnw`.
If you'd prefer to install your own Maven and don't already have it, xref:../X-appendix/installing-maven.adoc[see the instructions at the end of the workshop].

[WARNING]
====
This workshop assumes a bash shell.
If you run on Windows, in particular, adjust the commands accordingly or install WSL.
See xref:../X-appendix/wsl.adoc[the appendix for installation instructions].
====

== Getting Started

Once you have installed all the prerequisites, you can start the workshop.
Unzip the workshop archive and open a terminal in the `quarkus-llm-workshop` directory.
Then, run the following command to start the workshop:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean verify -DskipTests
----

This command will build the code of the workshop.
During the workshop, we will look into each part of the code, explaining how it works and explain how to run the various applications.

Time to see some code in action!
