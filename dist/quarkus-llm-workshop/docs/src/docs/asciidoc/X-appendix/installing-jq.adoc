= jq

Very often, when using cURL to invoke a RESTful web service, we get some JSON payload.
cURL does not format this JSON so that you will get a flat String such as:

[source,shell]
----
curl http://localhost:8083/api/heroes
[{"id":"1","name":"Chewbacca","level":"14"},{"id":"2","name":"Wonder Woman","level":"15"},{"id":"3","name":"Anakin Skywalker","level":"8"}]
----

But what we want is to format the JSON payload, so it is easier to read.
For that, there is a neat utility tool called `jq` that we could use.
`jq` is a tool for processing JSON inputs, applying the given filter to its JSON text inputs, and producing the filter's results as JSON on standard output.footnote:[jq https://stedolan.github.io/jq]

== Checking for jq Installation

Once installed, it's just a matter of piping the cURL output to jq like this:

[source,shell]
----
curl http://localhost:8083/api/heroes | jq

[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Chewbacca",
    "lastName": "14"
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "name": "Wonder Woman",
    "lastName": "15"
  },
  {
    "id": "3",
    "name": "Anakin Skywalker",
    "lastName": "8"
  }
]
